One challenge with animation-heavy websites is maintainability. Bundling all animations into a single file or component can quickly become difficult to manage, especially as complexity of interaction  grows.

To address this, I'm taking an isolation-first approach â€” each animation is scoped to its own component or context. This makes it significantly easier to:

Track down bugs or unexpected behavior

Tweak or optimize individual animations

Reuse animations across the project without side effects

This modular setup improves debuggability, readability, and scalability as the project evolves.
